          <p class="text-white-50">EntoGEM is a community-driven systematic mapping project of global insect status and trends. Our goal is to assess the current state of evidence in the scientific literature regarding insect declines, increases, or other trends. <br><br>To do this, we are taking a community-driven approach, meaning that everyone who has a stake in the project is invited to participate in the planning and review process, whether they are an entomologist, conservation biologist, insect enthusiast, systematic review expert, policy maker, or anyone else who thinks it is important to know the state of the evidence regarding global insects.</p>

<img src="img/Metallic_wood-boring_beetle.jpg" align="left" width=30% height=30% hspace=10px vspace=10px>Recent studies documenting declines in insect abundance and biodiversity have raised concerns about a global insect conservation crisis with potentially dire consequences. There are over five and a half million insect species globally that are critical to maintaining ecosystem integrity; they fill roles as pollinators, herbivores, decomposers, and prey for other organisms. 
</p>                      <p class="text-black-50"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html"><img src="img/nyt.png" width=40% height=40% align="right" hspace=10px></a>
Media coverage of the potential consequences of losing insect species has raised public interest in the topic of insect conservation. News stories like the "The Insect Apocalypse is Here" in the <i>New York Times</i> pointed to the "windshield phenomenon" noticed by entomologists and evidence of this trend from studies like the Krefeld study. Long-term insect studies like Krefeld are rare, and disparities in where insect research has been conducted historically limits our ability to make inferences about global insect trends from a handful of studies. 
<br>
</p>
<p class="text-black-50">The growing concern about global insect declines both in academic and public spheres has led some researchers to call for more primary studies. To effectively plan primary studies, however, as a community we need to identify gaps in our knowledge and prioritize areas of research that have the most critical needs for conservation and policy-making. To do this, we need to undertake a systematic map to synthesize the available evidence and get a clear picture of the current state of the literature.

<img src="img/silvery_blues.jpg" align="left" width=40% height=40% hspace=10px vspace=10px>A systematic map is a form of evidence synthesis. Evidence synthesis incorporates information from multiple sources to inform decisions on a specific issue using techniques like systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Unlike systematic reviews or meta-analyses that aim to answer specific questions related to impacts or effectiveness of different management decisions and policies, systematic maps aim to describe the state of evidence bases.  </p>
            

<p class="text-white-50">
  Systematic maps can be used to highlight knowledge gaps and knowledge clusters, helping to direct efforts towards funding and conducting necessary primary research. The output of a systematic map is a searchable database of studies on a broad subject, which can be a jumping off point for future, more in-depth systematic reviews and meta-analyses on knowledge clusters identified through the mapping process. </p>

<p class="text-white-50">
<img src="img/army_ants.jpg" align="right" width=35% height=35% hspace=10px vspace=10px>
To map the state of the evidence on global insect trends, we are organizing a community-driven systematic mapping project guided by a core group of subject experts and research synthesis experts. The final product of this project will be a global, multi-lingual map of all known studies, published and unpublished, that document evidence of insect population and biodiversity trends over time.

We are using SysRev.com to facilitate article screening by anyone who has a stake in the project. To ensure reliability during the screening process, every article will be screened by at least two community members who have completed a brief training module on how to apply the eligibility criteria. <br> <br> Article screening will begin in early August.

            Given the importance and urgency of knowing the state of the evidence regarding insect population and biodiversity trends, we are currently pursuing this project as a labor of love without any funding. Because it is secondary research, there are no direct costs incurred for supplies, however, the project requires time and effort by the project coordinators and the community which is invaluable. 
            </p>
            

<p class="text-white-50">
            Currently, our top funding priority is teaching relief for the project coordinators to have more time dedicated to the project. If you know of any grants or funding sources that could support their time on the project, or if you are affiliated with an organization that would like to support the project, please let us know!
